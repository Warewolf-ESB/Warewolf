/**
 * @description
 *
 * Syncs a `FormControl` in an existing `FormGroup` to a form control
 * element by name.
 *
 * This directive ensures that any values written to the `FormControl`
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * `FormControl` instance (view -> model).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * This directive is designed to be used with a parent `FormGroupDirective` (selector:
 * `[formGroup]`).
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the `FormControl` instance you want to
 * link, and will look for a `FormControl` registered with that name in the
 * closest `FormGroup` or `FormArray` above it.
 *
 * **Access the control**: You can access the `FormControl` associated with
 * this directive by using the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('first');`
 *
 * **Get value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the `FormControl`.
 * See a full list of available properties in `AbstractControl`.
 *
 *  **Set value**: You can set an initial value for the control when instantiating the
 *  `FormControl`, or you can set it programmatically later using
 *  {@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * * Selects: `SelectControlValueAccessor`
 *
 * ### Use with ngModel
 *
 * Support for using the `ngModel` input property and `ngModelChange` event with reactive
 * form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed in Angular v7.
 *
 * Now deprecated:
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [formGroup]="form">
 *   <input formControlName="first" [(ngModel)]="value">
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * This has been deprecated for a few reasons. First, developers have found this pattern
 * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's
 * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply
 * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value
 * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like
 * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,
 * which has understandably caused some confusion.
 *
 * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which
 * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of
 * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic
 * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in
 * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.
 *
 * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form
 * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to
 * template-driven directives.
 *
 * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [formGroup]="form">
 *   <input formControlName="first">
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.form.get('first').setValue('some value');
 * ```
 *
 * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev
 * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for
 * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:
 *
 * ```ts
 * imports: [
 *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this
 * pattern with a config value of `"always"`. This may help to track down where in the code
 * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.
