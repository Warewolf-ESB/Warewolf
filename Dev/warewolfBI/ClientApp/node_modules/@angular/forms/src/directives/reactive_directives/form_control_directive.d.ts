/**
 * @description
 *
 * Syncs a standalone `FormControl` instance to a form control element.
 *
 * This directive ensures that any values written to the `FormControl`
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * `FormControl` instance (view -> model).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a `FormControl` instance directly.
 * Simply create a `FormControl`, save it to your component class, and pass it into the
 * `FormControlDirective`.
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike `FormControlName`,
 * it does not require that your `FormControl` instance be part of any parent
 * `FormGroup`, and it won't be registered to any `FormGroupDirective` that
 * exists above it.
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * `FormControl` instance. See a full list of available properties in
 * `AbstractControl`.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the `FormControl`,
 * or you can set it programmatically later using {@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or
 * {@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Use with ngModel
 *
 * Support for using the `ngModel` input property and `ngModelChange` event with reactive
 * form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed in Angular v7.
 *
 * Now deprecated:
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [formControl]="control" [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * This has been deprecated for a few reasons. First, developers have found this pattern
 * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's
 * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply
 * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value
 * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like
 * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,
 * which has understandably caused some confusion.
 *
 * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which
 * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of
 * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic
 * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in
 * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.
 *
 * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form
 * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to
 * template-driven directives.
 *
 * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [formControl]="control">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.control.setValue('some value');
 * ```
 *
 * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):
 *
 * ```html
 * <input [(ngModel)]="value">
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * this.value = 'some value';
 * ```
 *
 * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev
 * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for
 * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:
 *
 * ```ts
 * imports: [
 *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this
 * pattern with a config value of `"always"`. This may help to track down where in the code
 * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.
