/**
 * Class for determining, from a list of tiles, the (row, col) position of each of those tiles
 * in the grid. This is necessary (rather than just rendering the tiles in normal document flow)
 * because the tiles can have a rowspan.
 *
 * The positioning algorithm greedily places each tile as soon as it encounters a gap in the grid
 * large enough to accommodate it so that the tiles still render in the same order in which they
 * are given.
 *
 * The basis of the algorithm is the use of an array to track the already placed tiles. Each
 * element of the array corresponds to a column, and the value indicates how many cells in that
 * column are already occupied; zero indicates an empty cell. Moving "down" to the next row
 * decrements each value in the tracking array (indicating that the column is one cell closer to
 * being free).
