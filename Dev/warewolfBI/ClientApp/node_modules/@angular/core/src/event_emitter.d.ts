/**
 * Use in directives and components to emit custom events synchronously
 * or asynchronously, and register handlers for those events by subscribing
 * to an instance.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * In the following example, a component defines two output properties
 * that create event emitters. When the title is clicked, the emitter
 * emits an open or close event to toggle the current visibility state.
 *
 * ```
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'zippy',
 *   template: `
 *   <div class="zippy">
 *     <div (click)="toggle()">Toggle</div>
 *     <div [hidden]="!visible">
 *       <ng-content></ng-content>
 *     </div>
 *  </div>`})
 * export class Zippy {
 *   visible: boolean = true;
 *   @Output() open: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();
 *   @Output() close: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.visible = !this.visible;
 *     if (this.visible) {
 *       this.open.emit(null);
 *     } else {
 *       this.close.emit(null);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Access the event object with the `$event` argument passed to the output event
 * handler:
 *
 * ```
 * <zippy (open)="onOpen($event)" (close)="onClose($event)"></zippy>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Notes
 *
 * Uses Rx.Observable but provides an adapter to make it work as specified here:
 * https://github.com/jhusain/observable-spec
 *
 * Once a reference implementation of the spec is available, switch to it.
