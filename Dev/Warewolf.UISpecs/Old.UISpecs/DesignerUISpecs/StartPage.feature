Feature: StartPage
	In order to avoid silly mistakes
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sum of two numbers

@StartPage
#Scenario: StartPageLogin
	#Given I have Warewolf running
	#And all tabs are closed
	#And I click point "0,0" on ""
	#And "ACTIVETAB,Dev2.Studio.ViewModels.WorkSurface.WorkSurfaceContextViewModel,WebBrowserHost" is visible within "15" seconds
	#And I click point "-170,30" on "VARIABLE"
	#And I click point "-900,200" on "VARIABLE"
	#And I send "warewolfworks@gmail.com{TAB}" to ""
	#And I send "dev2tech{ENTER}" to ""
	#And some way to validate the login.
