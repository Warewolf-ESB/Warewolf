Feature: Count
	In order to count records
	As a Warewolf user
	I want a tool that takes a record set counts it

Scenario: Count a number of records in a recordset with 3 rows
	Given I have a recordset with this shape
	| [[rs]]   |   |
	| rs().row | 1 |
	| rs().row | 2 |
	| rs().row | 3 |
	And count on record "[[rs()]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 3
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as 
	| Recordset         |
	| [[rs(1).row]] = 1 |
	| [[rs(2).row]] = 2 |
	| [[rs(3).row]] = 3 |
	And the debug output as 
	|                |
	| [[result]] = 3 |

Scenario: Count a number of records in a recordset with 8 rows
	Given I have a recordset with this shape
	| rs       |   |
	| rs().row | 1 |
	| rs().row | 2 |
	| rs().row | 3 |
	| rs().row | 4 |
	| rs().row | 5 |
	| rs().row | 6 |
	| rs().row | 7 |
	| rs().row | 8 |
	And count on record "[[rs()]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 8
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| Recordset          |
	| [[rs(1).row]] =  1 |
	| [[rs(2).row]] =  2 |
	| [[rs(3).row]] =  3 |
	| [[rs(4).row]] =  4 |
	| [[rs(5).row]] =  5 |
	| [[rs(6).row]] =  6 |
	| [[rs(7).row]] =  7 |
	| [[rs(8).row]] =  8 |
	And the debug output as 
	|                 |
	| [[result]] = 8 |



Scenario: Count a number of records in a empty recordset
	Given I have a recordset with this shape
	| rs ||
	| [[rs().row]] | NULL |
	And count on record "[[rs()]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 0
	And the execution has "No" error

Scenario: Count a number of records in a unassigned recordset
	Given count on record "[[rs()]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the execution has "An" error


#Below 3 scenarios should be passed after the bug 12136 is fixed.
#This 3 scenarios are getting passed but error is not actually generating in studio and in browser too,
# please investigate why this specs are getting passed without the functionality is not coming right

	| rs().row | 4 |
	| rs().row | 5 |
	| rs().row | 6 |
	| rs().row | 7 |
	| rs().row | 8 |
	And count on record "[[rs().#$]]"

	| rs().row | 7 |
	| rs().row | 8 |
	And count on record "[[rs(*).row]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 0
	And the execution has "AN" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| Recordset          |
	And the debug output as 
	|              |

Scenario: Count only one coloumn record
	Given I have a recordset with this shape
	| rs       |   |
	| rs().row | 1 |
	| rs().row | 2 |
	| rs().row | 3 |
	| rs().row | 4 |
	| fs().row | 5 |
	| fs().row | 6 |
	| fs().row | 7 |
	| fs().row | 8 |
	And count on record "[[rs().row]],[[fs().row]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 0
	And the execution has "AN" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| Recordset          |
	And the debug output as 
	|              |

Scenario: Count a number of records when two recordsets are defined.

	| rs       |   |
	| rs().row | a |
	| fs().row | a |

	| rs(4).row | 4 |
	And count on record "[[rs()]]"
    And result variable as "[[b]][[a]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 0

	| Recordset         |
	| [[rs(1).row]] = 1 |
	| [[rs(2).row]] = 2 |
	| [[rs(3).row]] = 3 |
	| [[rs(4).row]] = 4 |
	And the debug output as

Scenario Outline: Ensure variables of different types produce desired results
	Given I have a recordset with this shape
	| [[rs]]   |   |
	| rs().row | 1 |
	| rs().row | 2 |
	| rs().row | 3 |
	And count on record "<count>"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be "<val>"
	And the execution has "<error>" error
Examples: 
| Count                        | val | error | Message                   |
|                              | 0   | AN    | Recordset not given       |
| [[var]]                      | 0   | AN    | Scalar not allowed        |
| [[q]]                        | 0   | AN    | Value must be a recordset |
| Test                         | 0   | AN    | Value must be a recordset |
| 99                           | 0   | AN    | Value must be a recordset |
| [[rs([[var]])]]              | 0   | AN    | [[result]] = Error        |


#Complex Types WOLF-1042
@ignore
Scenario Outline: Ensure the correct values are returned using complex types
	Given I have a complex type with this shape
	| complex types  |   |
	| rs().row().set | 1 |
	| rs().row().set | 2 |
	| rs().row().set | 3 |
	And count on record "[[rs().row()]]"	
	When the count tool is executed
	Then the result count should be 3
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as 
	| Recordset               |
	| [[rs().row(1).set]] = 1 |
	| [[rs().row(2).set]] = 2 |
	| [[rs().row(3).set]] = 3 |
	And the debug output as "<Debug>" with "<Output>"
Examples: 
| Debug              | Output                             |
| [[rec().a]]        | [[rec(1).a]] = 3                   |
