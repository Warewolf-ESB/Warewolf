Scenario Outline: Calculate the number of months between two given dates using variables and recordsets
	Given I have a DateAndTimeDifference variable "<input1>" equal to <Val1>
	Given I have a DateAndTimeDifference variable "<input2>" equal to <Val2>
	Given I have a DateAndTimeDifference variable "<inputformat>" equal to <Val3>
	Given I have a first date "<input1>" 
	And I have a second date "<input2>" 
	And the date format as "<inputformat>"
	And I selected output in "Months" 	
	And DateTimeDifference result variable is "<res>"
	When the datetime difference tool is executed
	Then the difference should be "7"
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the result variable '<res>' will be '<result>'
Examples: 
	| input1       | Val1       | input2      | Val2       | inputformat | Val3       | res           | result |

	And I have a second date "[[b]]" equals ""
	And the date format as "[[v]]" equals ""
	And I selected output in "years" 	
	When the datetime difference tool is executed
	Then the difference should be ""
