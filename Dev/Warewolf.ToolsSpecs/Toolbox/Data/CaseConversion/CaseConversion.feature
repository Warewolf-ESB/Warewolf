Scenario Outline: Convert a sentence to uppercase using complex types
	Given I have a case convert variable '<variable>' with a value of '<value>'
	And I convert a variable '<variable>' to '<To>'

	Then the sentence will be '<result>'
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| # | Convert              | To   |
	| 1 | <variable> = <value> | <To> |
	And the debug output as
