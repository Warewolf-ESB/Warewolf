Feature: DataSplit
	In order to split data
	As a Warewolf user
	I want a tool that splits two or more pieces of data

Scenario: Split text to a recordset using Index using Star notation
	Given A string to split with value "abcde"
	And  assign to variable "[[vowels(*).letters]]" split type "Index" at "1" and Include "unselected"
	When the data split tool is executed
	Then the split recordset "[[vowels(*).letters]]" will be
	| rs           | value |
	| vowels().row | a     |
	| vowels().row | b     |
	| vowels().row | c     |
	| vowels().row | d     |
	| vowels().row | e     |
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| String to Split | Process Direction | Skip blank rows | # |                         | With  | Using | Include | Escape |
	| abcde           | Forward           | No              | 1 | [[vowels(*).letters]] = | Index | 1     | No      |        |
    And the debug output as
