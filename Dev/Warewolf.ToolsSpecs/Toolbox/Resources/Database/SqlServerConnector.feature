Feature: SqlServerConnector
	In order to manage my database services
	As a Warewolf User
	I want to be shown the database service setup

Scenario: Opening Saved workflow with SQL Server tool
   Given I open workflow with database connector
	And Source is Enabled
	And Source is "testingDBSrc"
	And Action is Enabled
	And Action is "dbo.Pr_CitiesGetCountries"
	And Inputs is Enabled
	And Inputs appear as
	| Input | Value      | Empty is Null |
	| Prefix | [[Prefix]] | false         |
	And Validate is Enabled
	Then Outputs appear as
	| Mapped From | Mapped To                                   | 
	| CountryID   | [[dbo_Pr_CitiesGetCountries().CountryID]]   |
	| Description | [[dbo_Pr_CitiesGetCountries().Description]] |
	And Recordset Name equals "dbo_Pr_CitiesGetCountries"

Scenario: Change Source on Existing tool
	Given I open workflow with database connector
	And Source is Enabled
	And Source is "testingDBSrc"
	And Action is Enabled
	And Action is "dbo.Pr_CitiesGetCountries"
	And Inputs is Enabled
	And Inputs appear as
	| Input | Value | Empty is Null |
	| Prefix | [[Prefix]]    | false         | 
	And Validate is Enabled
	Then Outputs appear as
	| Mapped From | Mapped To                                   | 
	| CountryID   | [[dbo_Pr_CitiesGetCountries().CountryID]]   |
	| Description | [[dbo_Pr_CitiesGetCountries().Description]] |
	And Recordset Name equals "dbo_Pr_CitiesGetCountries"
	When Source is changed from to "GreenPoint"
	Then Action is Enabled
	And Inputs is Disabled 
	And Outputs is Disabled
	And Validate is Enabled
