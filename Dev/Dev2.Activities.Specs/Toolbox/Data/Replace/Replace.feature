Scenario Outline:  Ensuring recordsets work as a Result
	Given I have a replace variable "[[sentence]]" equal to "Dear Mr XXXX, We welcome you as a customer"
	And I have a sentence "[[sentence]]"
	And I have a replace variable "<value>" equal to "<replace>"
	And I have a replace variable "[[var]]" equal to "1"
	And I want to find the characters "XXXX"
	And I want to replace them with "<value>"
	And replace result is "<resultVar>"
	When the replace tool is executed
	Then the execution has "NO" error
	And the result variable '<resultVar>' will be '<result>'
Examples: 
| value         | replace | resultVar               | result | output                                                    |
| [[text]]      | West    | [[rec().string]]        | 1      | [[sentence]] = Dear Mr West, We welcome you as a customer |
| [[rs(*).val]] | Wii     | [[rec().string]]        | 1      | [[sentence]] = Dear Mr Wii, We welcome you as a customer  |
| [[text]]      | West    | [[rec(1).string]]       | 1      | [[sentence]] = Dear Mr West, We welcome you as a customer |
| [[text]]      | West    | [[rec([[var]]).string]] | 1      | [[sentence]] = Dear Mr West, We welcome you as a customer |
| [[text]]      | West    | [[rec(*).string]]       | 1      | [[sentence]] = Dear Mr West, We welcome you as a customer |

Scenario Outline: Replace values using complex types
	Given I have a replace variable "<var>" equal to "<value>"
	And I have a sentence "<var>"
	And I want to find the characters "<characters>" 
	And I want to replace them with "<replacement>" 
	When the replace tool is executed
	Then the replace result should be "<count>"
