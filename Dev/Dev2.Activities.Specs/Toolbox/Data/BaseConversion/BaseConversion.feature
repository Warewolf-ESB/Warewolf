Scenario: Convert a Variable That Does Not Exist
	Given I have a convert variable "[[var]]" with a value of "[[a]]"
	And I convert a variable "[[var]]" from type "Text" to type "Binary" 
	When the base conversion tool is executed
	Then the execution has "AN" error
 
Scenario Outline: Convert an empty recordset * 
	Given I convert a variable "<Variable>" with a value of "<value>"
	And I convert a variable '<Variable>' from type '<From>' to type '<To>' 
	When the case conversion tool is executed
	Then the execution has "AN" error
	And the execution has "<Error>" error
