Feature: FindRecordsetIndexMultiple
	In order to search for pieces of data in a recordset
	As a Warewolf user
	I want a tool I can use to find an index 

Scenario: Find an index of data in a recordset with Is Between numeric
	Given I have the following recordset to search for multiple criteria
	| rs         | value |
	| rs().field | 1     |
	| rs().field | 15    |
	| rs().field | 20    |
	| rs().field | 34    |
	And field to search is "[[rs().field]]"	
	And  is between search the recordset with type "Is Between" and criteria is "16" and "33"
	When the find records index multiple tool is executed
	Then the find records index multiple result should be 3
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as
