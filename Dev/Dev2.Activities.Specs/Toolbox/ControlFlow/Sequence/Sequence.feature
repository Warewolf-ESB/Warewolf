Feature: Sequence
	In order to execute sequence 
	As a Warewolf user
	I want to a tool that will allow me to construct and execute tools and services in sequence

Scenario: Execute Sequence with Assign
          Given I have a Sequence "Test"
          And "Test" contains an Assign "TestAssign" as
          | variable | value |
          | [[var1]] | 1     |
          | [[var2]] | 2     |
          When the Sequence tool is executed
          Then the execution has "NO" error
          And the "TestAssign" debug inputs as
          | # | Variable   | New Value |
          | 1 | [[var1]] = | 1         |
          | 2 | [[var2]] = | 2         |
          And the "TestAssign" debug outputs as
