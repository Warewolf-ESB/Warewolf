Scenario Outline: Execute a foreach over a tool using complex types
	Given There is a recordset in the datalist with this shape
	| rs                     | value |
	| [[rs().field().value]] | 1     |
	| [[rs().field().value]] | 2     |
	| [[rs().field().value]] | 3     |	
	And I have selected the foreach type as "<Type>" and used "<variable>"
