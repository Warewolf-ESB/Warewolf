@WorkflowExecution
Feature: WorkflowExecution
	In order to execute a workflow on the server
	As a Warewolf user
	I want to be able to build workflows and execute them against the server

Background: Setup for workflow execution
			Given Debug events are reset
			And All environments disconnected
			And Debug states are cleared

	  And "Spec - Test For Each  Get" contains "GetRequestErrorHandling" from server "localhost" with mapping as
	  | Input to Service | From Variable | Output from Service | To Variable |
	  |                  |               | Result              | [[Result]]  |
	  When "Spec - Test For Each  Get" is executed
	  Then the workflow execution has "AN" error	  
	  And the 'GetRequestErrorHandling' in Workflow 'Spec - Test For Each  Get' debug outputs as
	  |                   |
	  | [[Result]] = Pass |


Scenario: Error not bubbling up
	Given I have a workflow "Wolf-1212_Test"

	  |                  |               | Error              | [[Error]]  |
	When "Wolf-1212_Test" is executed
	Then the workflow execution has "NO" error
	And the 'ErrorHandled' in Workflow 'Wolf-1212_Test' debug outputs as
	  |                                                                                                                                     |

Scenario: Error not bubbling up error message
	Given I have a workflow "Wolf-1212_2"
