Feature: WorkflowResume
	When a workflow execution fails
	I want to Resume
	
@ResumeWorkflowExecution
Scenario: Resuming a workflow that had failed to connect
	Given I have a workflow "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer"
	And "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" contains an Assign "AssignNumber" as
	 | variable   | value |
	 | [[number]] | 1     |
	And "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" contains a mysql database service "ToolUsingContainerAsTheSource"
	And "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" contains an Assign "IncrementNumber" as
	 | variable      | value         |
	 | [[outnumber]] | =[[number]]+1 |
    When "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" is executed
    Then the workflow execution has "AN" error
	And execution stopped on error and did not execute "IncrementNumber"
	And the "ToolUsingContainerAsTheSource" in Workflow "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" has an error
	When I startup the mysql container
	And I select "NewMySqlSource" for "ToolUsingContainerAsTheSource" as Source 
	And I select "Pr_CitiesGetCountries" Action for "ToolUsingContainerAsTheSource" tool
	And "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" is Saved
	And I resume workflow "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" at "ToolUsingContainerAsTheSource" tool
	Then Resume has "NO" error
	And Resume message is "Execution Completed."
	And the "IncrementNumber" in Workflow "WorkflowWithMysqlToolUsingContainer" debug outputs as
	  | # |                    |
	  | 1 |  [[outnumber]] = 2 |


Scenario: Resuming a workflow Given No Name And Resume From SetTheOutputVariable tool
	Given I have a server at "localhost" with workflow "Hello World"
	And Workflow "Hello World" has "Set the output variable (1)" activity
	And I resume workflow "Hello World" at "Set the output variable (1)" tool
	Then Resume has "AN" error
	And Resume message is "Scalar value { Name } is NULL"


Scenario: Resuming a workflow Given Resume From AssignValueToNameIfBlank Tool
	Given I have a server at "localhost" with workflow "Hello World"
	And Workflow "Hello World" has "Assign a value to Name if blank (1)" activity
	And I resume workflow "Hello World" at "Assign a value to Name if blank (1)" tool
	Then Resume has "NO" error
	And Resume message is "Execution Completed."

@ResumeWorkflowExecution
Scenario: Resuming Workflow From a specific Version 
	Given I have a workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion"
	And "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" contains an Assign "VarsAssign" as
	| variable    | value |
	| [[rec().a]] | New   |
	| [[rec().a]] | Test  |	 
	When workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" is saved "1" time
	Then workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" has "0" Versions in explorer
	When "WorkflowWithAssignAndCount" is executed
	Then the workflow execution has "NO" error
	And the "VarsAssign" in Workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" debug outputs as    
	| # |                     |
	| 1 | [[rec(1).a]] = New  |
	| 2 | [[rec(2).a]] = Test |
	Then I update "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" by adding "AnotherVarsAssign" as
	| variable     | value              |
	| [[variable]] | NewlyAddedVariable |
	When workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" is saved "1" time	
	Then I update "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" by adding "ThirVarAssign" as
	| variable                | value               |
	| [[ThirdAssignVariable]] | ThirdAssignVariable |
	When workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" is saved "1" time
	And I reload Server resources
	And I resume the workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" at "VarsAssign" from version "2"
	Then the workflow execution has "NO" error
	And the "VarsAssign" in Workflow "ResumeWorkflowFromVersion" debug outputs as    
	| # |                        |
	| 1 | [[rec(1).a]] = New     |
	| 2 | [[rec(2).a]] = Test    |
