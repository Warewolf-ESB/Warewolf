Feature: WorkflowExecutionLogging
    In order to get a detailed workflow execution log
    As a warewolf user
    I want to be able to list all entry to exit execution log points

Scenario: Workflow execution entry point detailed log
    Given "Hello World" stop on error is set to "false"
    And an existing workflow "Hello World"
	When a "Hello World" workflow request is received
    Then a detailed entry log is created
    | key           | value                         |
    | DsfDecision   | If [[Name]] <> (Not Equal)    |
    And it has these input parameter values
    | key       | value     |
    | [[Name]]  | World     |
    And execution is complete

Scenario: Workflow execution stops on error detailed logs
    Given "Hello World" stop on error is set to "true"
    And workflow execution entry point detailed logs are created and logged
    When a workflow stops on error
    Then execution is complete

Scenario: Workflow execution completed detailed logs
    Given "Hello World" stop on error is set to "false"
    And workflow execution entry point detailed logs are created and logged
    And a workflow stops on error has no logs
    Then a detailed execution completed log entry is created
    | key                       | value                         |
    | DsfMultiAssignActivity    | Set the output variable (1)   |
    And it has these output parameter values
    | key           | value         |
    | [[Message]]   | Hello World.  |
    And execution is complete

Scenario: Workflow execution failure detailed logs
    Given "Hello World" stop on error is set to "false"
    And the workflow is expected to throw exception
    And workflow execution entry point detailed logs are created and logged
    And a workflow stops on error has no logs
    When a workflow execution has an exception
    Then a detailed execution exception log entry is created
    | key       | value                                               |
    | Exception | False exception from WorkflowExecutionLoggingSteps  |
    And a detailed execution completed log entry will have no logs
    And execution is complete
