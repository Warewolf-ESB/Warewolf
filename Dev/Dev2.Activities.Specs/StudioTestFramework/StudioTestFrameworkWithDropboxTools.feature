		Given I have "Workflow 2" with inputs as
			| Input Var Name |
			| [[rec().a]]    |
			| [[rec().b]]    |
		And "Workflow 2" has outputs as
			| Ouput Var Name |
			| [[returnVal]]  |
		Given I have "Workflow 3" with inputs as

		Given I have "WorkflowWithTests" with inputs as 
			| Input Var Name |
			| [[input]]      |
		And "WorkflowWithTests" has outputs as
			| Ouput Var Name  |
			| [[outputValue]] |			
		And "WorkflowWithTests" Tests as 
			| TestName | AuthenticationType | Error | TestFailing | TestPending | TestInvalid | TestPassed |
			| Test1    | Windows            | false | false       | false       | false       | true       |
			| Test2    | Windows            | false | true        | false       | false       | false      |
