Feature: StudioTestFrameworkWithDatabaseTools
	In order to test workflows that contain database tools in warewolf 
	As a user
	I want to create, edit, delete and update tests in a test window


Background: Setup for workflows for tests
		Given test folder is cleaned	
		And I have "Workflow 1" with inputs as
			| Input Var Name |
			| [[a]]          |
		And "Workflow 1" has outputs as
			| Ouput Var Name  |
			| [[outputValue]] |		
		Given I have "Workflow 2" with inputs as
			| Input Var Name |
			| [[rec().a]]    |
			| [[rec().b]]    |
		And "Workflow 2" has outputs as
			| Ouput Var Name |
			| [[returnVal]]  |
		Given I have "Workflow 3" with inputs as
			| Input Var Name |
			| [[A]]              |
			| [[B]]              |

		And "Workflow 3" has outputs as
			| Ouput Var Name |
			| [[message]]    |
		Given I have "WorkflowWithTests" with inputs as 
			| Input Var Name |
			| [[input]]      |
		And "WorkflowWithTests" has outputs as
			| Ouput Var Name  |
			| [[outputValue]] |			
		And "WorkflowWithTests" Tests as 
			| TestName | AuthenticationType | Error | TestFailing | TestPending | TestInvalid | TestPassed |
			| Test1    | Windows            | false | false       | false       | false       | true       |
