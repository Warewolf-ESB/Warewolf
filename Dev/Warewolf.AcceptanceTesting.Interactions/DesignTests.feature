	  And I have "Assign" on "Unsaved 1" 
	  And I have "Data Merge" on "Unsaved 1"
	  When I Debug "Unsaved 1"
	  And variable list is "Visible"
	  Then debug output is "Visible"
	  And Save is "Enabled"
	  When I click on "Save"
	  Then "save" dialogbox is opened
	  When I save as "Floating"
	  Then the "Unsaved 1" is updated as "Floating"


Scenario: Save enables depends on focus when Floating design surface and settings 
     Given I have "Unsave 1" is opened on design surface
     And I have "Assign" on "Unsaved 1"
     And I have "Settings" opened
     When I Float the "Unsaved 1"
     And I Float the "Settings"
     When I have focus at "Unsaved 1"
	 Then Save is "Enabled"
	 When I have focus at "Settings"
	 Then Save is "Disabled"



Scenario: Floating all the screens and minimizing
    Given I have studio running
	And I have "Settings" opened
	And Explorer is "Visible"
	And Variable list is "Visible"
	And Toolbox is "Visible"
	When I float "Explorer"
	Then explorer has "Mininize" option
	And explorer has "Maximize" option
	When i click on explorer "Mininize"
	Then explorer is "Mininmized"
	When I float "Toolbox"
	Then Toolbox has "Mininize" option
	And Toolbox has "Maximize" option
	When I click on Toolbox "Mininize"
	Then Toolbox is "Mininmized"
	When I click on toolbox "Maximize"
	Then toolbox is "Maximized"
	When I click on explorer "Maximize"
	Then explorer is "Maximized"



Scenario: Floating output is generating debug output
    Given I have "Unsaved 1" opened on design surface
	And I have "Assign" on "Unsaved 1"
	And I have "Data Merge" on "Unsaved 1"
	And I float "Debug Output"
	And I focused at "Unsaved 1"
	When I debug
	Then debug output is generated
	And "Assign" is visible in debug output
	And "Data Merge" is visible in debug output
