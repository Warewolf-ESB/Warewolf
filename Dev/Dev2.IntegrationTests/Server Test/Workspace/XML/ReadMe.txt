Verification of signed Calculate_RecordSet_Subtract fails !! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Probably caused by Visual Studio's knack for auto-formatting XML when pasting 
The XML to be verified needs to be in EXACTLY the same format it was when it was signed
- any extra spaces will cause it to FAIL
