Scenario: Creating New Redis Source
	Given I open New Redis Source
	Then "New Redis Source" tab is opened
	And title is "New Redis Source"
	Given I type HostName as a valid anonymous redis server
	Then server port is "6379"
	And I type port number as "6379"
	Then "New Redis Source *" tab is opened
	And "Save" is "Enabled"
	And "Test Connection" is "Enabled"
	And "Cancel Test" is "Disabled"
	And I Select Authentication Type as "Anonymous"
	And Password field is "Collapsed"
	When Test Connecton is "Successful"
	And "Save" is "Enabled"
	When I save as "Testing Redis Source Save"
	Then the save dialog is opened
	Then title is "Testing Redis Source Save"
	And "Testing Redis Source Save" tab is opened
