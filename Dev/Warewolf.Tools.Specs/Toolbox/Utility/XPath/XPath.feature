Feature: XPath
	In order to run a query against xml
	As a Warewolf user
	I want a tool that I can use to execute xpath queries

Scenario: Use XPath to get data off XML - Id = 1
	Given I have this xml '<root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root>'
	And I have a variable "[[firstNum]]" output with xpath "//root/number[@id='1']/text()"
	When the xpath tool is executed
	Then the variable "[[firstNum]]" should have a value "One"
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| XML                                                                                              | # |                                              |
	| <root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root> | 1 | [[firstNum]] = //root/number[@id='1']/text() |
	And the debug output as 
	| # |                    |
	| 1 | [[firstNum]] = One |       

Scenario: Use XPath to get data off XML - Id = 2
	Given I have this xml '<root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root>'
	And I have a variable "[[firstNum]]" output with xpath "//root/number[@id='2']/text()"
	When the xpath tool is executed
	Then the variable "[[firstNum]]" should have a value "Two"
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| XML                                                                                              | # |                                              |
	| <root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root> | 1 | [[firstNum]] = //root/number[@id='2']/text() |
	And the debug output as 
	| # |                    |
	| 1 | [[firstNum]] = Two |

Scenario: Use XPath to build a recordset with 2 fields
	Given I have this xml '<root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root>'
	And I have a variable "[[rec(*).id]]" output with xpath "//root/number/@id"
	And I have a variable "[[rec2(*).text]]" output with xpath "//root/number/text()"
	When the xpath tool is executed
	Then the xpath result for this varibale "[[rec(*).id]]" will be
	| rec().id |
	| 1        |
	| 2        |
	| 3        |
	Then the xpath result for this varibale "[[rec2(*).text]]" will be
	| rec().text |
	| One        |
	| Two        |
	| Three      |
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| XML                                                                                              | # |                                         |
	| <root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root> | 1 | [[rec(*).id]] = //root/number/@id       |
	|                                                                                                  | 2 | [[rec2(*).text]] = //root/number/text() |
	And the debug output as 
	| # |                          |
	| 1 | [[rec(1).id]] = 1        |
	|   | [[rec(2).id]] = 2        |
	|   | [[rec(3).id]] = 3        |
	| 2 | [[rec2(1).text]] = One   |
	|   | [[rec2(2).text]] = Two   |
	|   | [[rec2(3).text]] = Three |  

Scenario: Use XPath that does not exist
	Given I have this xml '<root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root>'	
	And I have a variable "[[ids]]" output with xpath "//root/num/@id"
	When the xpath tool is executed
	Then the variable "[[ids]]" should have a value ""
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| XML                                                                                              | # |                          |
	| <root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root> | 1 | [[ids]] = //root/num/@id |
	And the debug output as 
	| # |           |
	| 1 | [[ids]] = |

Scenario: Use invalid xpath query
	Given I have this xml '<root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root>' in a variable "[[myxml]]"
	And I assign the variable "[[myxml]]" as xml input
	And I have a variable "[[ids]]" output with xpath "@@#$"
	When the xpath tool is executed
	Then the variable "[[ids]]" should have a value ""
	And the execution has "AN" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| XML                                                                                                          | # |                |
	| [[myxml]] = <root><number id="1">One</number><number id="2">Two</number><number id="3">Three</number></root> | 1 | [[ids]] = @@#$ |
	And the debug output as 
	| # |           |
