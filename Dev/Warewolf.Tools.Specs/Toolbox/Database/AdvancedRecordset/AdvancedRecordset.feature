Feature: AdvancedRecordset
    In order to validate sql executing over a recordset
    As a Warewolf developer
    I want to be what sql is supported

Scenario:  Select all
    Given I have a recordset with this shape
    | [[person]]    |        |
    | person().name | Bob    |
    | person().name | Alice  |
    | person().name | Hatter |
    And I drag on an Advanced Recordset tool
    And I have the following sql statement "SELECT * from person"
    When I click Generate Outputs
    Then Outputs are as follows
    | Mapped From | Mapped To            |
    | name        | [[TableCopy().name]] |
    And Recordset is "TableCopy"
    And Outputs are as follows
    | Mapped From | Mapped To            |
    | name        | [[TableCopy().name]] |
    When Advanced Recordset tool is executed
    Then recordset "[[TableCopy(*).name]]"  will be
    | rs               | value  |
    | TableCopy().name | Bob    |
    | TableCopy().name | Alice  |
    | TableCopy().name | Hatter |
    And the execution has "NO" error
    And the debug output as
    |                                |
    | [[TableCopy(3).name]] = Hatter |
