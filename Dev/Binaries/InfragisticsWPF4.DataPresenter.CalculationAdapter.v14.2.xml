            <summary>
            UltraCalcEngine has a requirement that two separate instances of ICalculationReference can't have 
            the same absolute name and not share the recalc flags or that two instances of 
            ICalculationReference have different absolute names but share the recalc flags. What this 
            means that since a NestedFieldReference with the context of the root rows collection has the 
            same absolute name as the associated FieldReference, we have to make sure to return the 
            ColumnRefernece instead of the NestedFieldReference in such cases where the nested column 
            reference absolute name happens to be the same as the associated column reference' absolute 
            name. This would occur like I said before when the NestedFieldReference has the root rows 
            collection context. We may have to also modify the NestedReference classes to delgate the recalc 
            flags to the associated non-nested references however as long as this fix works out we won't 
            have to do it. The reason why this is preferrable is that tokens in the formula should really be 
            getting the column and summarysettings references and not the nested ones when they are 
            reconnected.

            the parsed reference as returned by RefBase.ParsedReference property is still

            <summary>
            A helper method that parses out relative column(*) or summary() names, optionally preceded
            by series of "../" relative parent specifiers. This is to support [../../Summary()]
            and [../../column1(*)] types of references to allow for being able to refer to the parent 
            group's summary or cells. For example, in a group-by situation where customer rows are 
            grouped by State and City columns. Let's say you have a summary with formula 
            Total() = sum([column1]). A column formula of [Total()] refers to the total of the current 
            city. A column formula of [../../Total()] referes to the total of the current state. Notice 
            how we are using two sets of double dots; this is because one set has no meaning (as
            was decided by the Melville team). In other words [Total()] and [../Total()] refer
            to the same summary and this is consistant with how [column1] and [../column1] refer
            to the same column in a column formula. The same logic as summaries applies to column(*)
            references too. Examples of anologous column references are [column1(*)], [../../column1(*)]. 
            [column1(*)] reference resolves to all the column1 cells in the current group
            of rows, current City in our example. [../../column1(*)] resolves to all the cells
            in the current State, which is the parent group-by column.
