@VariableList
Feature: VariableList
	In order to manage my variables
	As a Warewolf user
	I want to be told shown all variables in my workflow service


## System Requirements for Variable List
#Ensure variables used in the tools are adding automatically to variable list.
#Ensure user is able search for variable in variable list.
#Ensure search clear button is clearing text in variable list search box.
#Ensure user is able to Delete all the unused variables in variable list.
#Ensure sort alphabetically button is available in variable list box.
#Ensure scalar variables are Sorting alphabetically when user clicks on sort button.
#Ensure Recordset variables are Sorting alphabetically when user clicks on sort button.
#Ensure user is able to select variables as input.
#Ensure user is able to select variables as output.
#Ensure delete button in the textbox is deleting variable in the variable textbox.
#Ensure removal from design surface updates list and list updates change list correctly
#Ensure bad variable names are in an error state
#Ensure unused variables do not appear in Debug Input window
#Ensure shorcut keys work

	 | [[a]]    |      |       | YES    |        |
	 | [[b]]    |      | YES   |        |        |
	When I save workflow as "test"
	And create variable "[[c]]" equals "" as ""
	And I save "Mapping"
	And "Mapping" is visible in the explorer
	When I right click "Mapping" and "Show Version History"
	Then version history is visible in the explorer
	And I open "v1" of "Mapping"
	Then the variables appear as
   | Variable | Note | Input | Output | IsUsed |
   | [[a]]    |      |       | YES    |        |
   | [[b]]    |      | YES   |        |        |
