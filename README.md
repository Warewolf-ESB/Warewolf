**NOTE:** Warewolf is currently undergoing some major code changes as well as a [Studio redesign](http://warewolf.io/ESB-blog/big-ui-changes-coming-to-warewolf-studio/). We’ve set the default branch to *development-stable*, please use that branch if you need a stable build. 
To see how things are progressing with the redesign feel free to grab the *development branch*.



**What is Warewolf ESB all about?**

We’re making integration into a simple, seamless process. Warewolf helps you quickly design, orchestrate and implement communication between software applications. Easily manage messaging, routing, and service co-ordination in a SOA framework.




**Who can help?**

Everyone! But it really helps if you’re a C# developer, or a WPF expert.
You could be recognised as a [top contributor](http://warewolf.io/contributors.php), and even get an original Warewolf T-shirt for your contribution.
