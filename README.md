**What is Warewolf all about?**

Service oriented architecture has finally entered the 21st century. Warewolf allows developers to use a visual, flow-based, drag and drop environment to design and create microservices, and then call those microservices from directly within their applications. The end result is months of programming accomplished in days and a total revolution in how we think about and use the SOA framework.
